    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Why?</h3>

    <p>Power cost in the UK has got silly. I wanted to know the most efficient power supply in my budget, for my
      machine. The data is out there - the good folks at Cybenetics have done some great independent reporting - but
      it's buried in PDFs. The only information they didn't have that mattered to me was warranty - that's manually
      added, so there will be some gaps for now.</p>
    <h3>How often is the site updated?</h3>

    <p>The site is updated every 24 hours. Periodically, it will have trouble reaching amazon for prices - in that case,
      it may be a little longer between updates.</p>

    <h3>Why aren't there amazon.com/amazon.ca prices?</h3>

    <p>Amazon has a wonderful API for gathering prices, but I can't currently can't use it due to needing a number of
      referrals before they'll grant you access. As soon as I have access, I will update to use their API and offer more
      sites.</p>
    <h3>Where do you get your data?</h3>

    <p>Prices are grabbed from regional amazon sites</p>

    <h3>How do you make money?</h3>

    <p>I receive commissions for products purchased through the links on this site through <a
        href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon's Affiliate Program]</a>. This does not
      affect the price you pay.</p>

    <h3>Are you stealing or selling my data?</h3>

    <p>This site uses the least intrusive analytics I'm aware of. No cookies are stored, and very little data is sent.
      For more information, take a look at the <a href="privacy.html">privacy policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>Will you add other sites for prices?</h3>

    <p>Maybe. This is a side project, that i'm just throwing out there to see what happens. If it sees some traffic,
      I'll dedicate some time to improvements.</p>
